This repository contains my learning journey on creating LLM applications using LangChain.

It uses the Gemini-2.5-Flash model, with an API key available under the free tier from Google AI Studio.

Some scripts were tested using sample datasets stored in the sample_data/ folder. These datasets are not included in this repository.
